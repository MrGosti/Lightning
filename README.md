Lightning
=========

A lite yet simple PHP framework. Using an intelligent package based dependencies system, Lightning load only the files you really need.
**Write code as faster as your website run**

Getting Started
------------------
**Hello World Tutorial**
First of all to understand the basis of Lightning logic you have to understand the MVC design pattern. Lightning kind of fork this pattern to make his very own. The architecture is as it follow:
- Modules
- Bundles
- Views

So what are the differences between this and a classic MVC pattern. The Modules are optional, there are kind of plugins that add functions and tools to your website to make the framework yours. The Bundles are a mix of what we call Controllers and Models. So basically all the query to the database and the modification of the results occurs in them.

So now that we know that let's dive into it.

First of all you have to configure the Framework. You will find in the Core folder a file named Configuration.php. This file contains all the essentials informations the framework needs to run correctly.
